The streaming data packet format can be found on page 52 of the [Opto22 Manual](http://documents.opto22.com/1465_OptoMMP_Protocol_Guide.pdf). Depending on the **type** of the input, the index will mean different things.\n_Note: Indexes are always 0-based, meaning we start counting from 0, not 1_\n### Float\nIf your input is a float, it will be read from the 256 bytes of analog floating point values. Each floating point value conforms to IEEE standards and, as a result, is 4 bytes long. This leaves 64 possible indexes for values.\nOn the Opto, each module contains 4 points. Therefore, the index is dependent on the module number and the point number on the module you wish to read. The following formula can be used to determine the index (assuming module and point numbers **start counting at 0**):\nINDEX = <MODULE INDEX> * 4 + <POINT INDEX>\nSo if you were interested in reading the 3rd point (point index `2`) on the 5th module (module index `4`), your resulting index would be `18`.\n### Integer\nIf your input is an integer, the process will be similar to that of a float. The integer type reads from the 256 bytes of counter data and the values are converted as unsigned 32-bit integers. This means, there are 64 possible indexes of integers to read from.\nSince these don't correspond to modules, the index should match the index of the counter you wish to read. So if you were interested in reading the 5th counter (counter index `4`), the resulting index would be `4`.\n### Digital\nReading digital points means reading only one bit from the 8 bytes of digital points. 8 bytes, with 8 bits per byte, leaves us 256 possible indexes of digital values to read from. However, the first 4 bits are always zero-filled, so in practice, there are only 252 actual digital values streamed.\nEach module can send 4 digital values, which will make up half of one byte. However, these digital values appear in reverse order (point 0 is the last one on the stream, point 3 is the first one). Therefore, the following formula can be used to determine the index of a digital point (again, assuming we start counting at 0):\nINDEX = 4 + (<MODULE INDEX> * 4) + (3 - <POINT INDEX>)\nThe first `+ 4` is there to account for the zero-filled bits at the beginning of the data section. So, if you were interested in reading the digital value from the 2nd point (point index `1`) on the 8th module (module index `7`), the resulting index would be `34`."
